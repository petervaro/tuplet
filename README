TUPLET
======

The tuplet package contains predefined variables, macros, configuration files
and an installer script. It supports developer and release variant builds for
both clang and gcc, provides clang static analyzer and valgrind macros.

Tuplet is part of the cini suite, so one could use it via the initializer script
implicitly, instead of following the step-by-step guide below!
